# Github Explore [WIP]

A cross platform app built on Ionic which allows you to explore and checkout users, repositories and organizations. Uses Github API v3


## Setup
It is required that Ionic 3 be preinstalled globally. Run these steps to quickly do so

```bash
npm install -g ionic cordova
```
Install all the required packages using npm

```bash
npm install
```

Serve the app to browser
```bash
ionic serve
```

Currently the APIs are hardcoded to run on localhost:3000. For dev purposed and using multiple APIs this port can be changed as per requirement.
