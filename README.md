A cross platform app built on Ionic which allows you to explore and checkout users, repositories and organizations.


## Setup
It is required that Ionic 3 be preinstalled globally. Run these steps to quickly do so

npm install -g ionic cordova
```
Install all the required packages using npm

```bash
npm install
```

Serve the app to browser
```bash
ionic serve
```

## Tech Stack
Uses the Github v3 REST API for data, Ionic 3 with Angular 4 as the frontend.
